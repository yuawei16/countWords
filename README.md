# CountWords

This is a console application developed using .net core 6.
It contains both the source and test codes. The application takes one argument which is a file name. It then extracts the file name without extention and counts its occurrence in the file. When it's done, it reports to the user.

Assumptions:
1. The file name is well-formed without any special charaters or endcodings.
2. The file contents are plain texts without bytes.
